## Look Around the Remote System

If you have not already connected to {{ site.remote.name }}, please do so now:

```
{{ site.local.prompt }}  ssh {{ site.remote.user }}@{{ site.remote.login }}
```
{: .language-bash}

Take a look at your home directory on the remote system:

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} ls
```
{: .language-bash}

Most high-performance computing systems run the Linux operating system, which
is built around the UNIX [Filesystem Hierarchy Standard][fshs]. Instead of
having a separate root for each hard drive or storage medium, all files and
devices are anchored to the "root" directory, which is `/`:

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} ls /
```
{: .language-bash}
```
bin   etc   lib64  proc  sbin     sys  var
boot  {{ site.remote.homedir | replace: "/", "" }}  mnt    root  scratch  tmp  working
dev   lib   opt    run   srv      usr
```
{: .output}

The "{{ site.remote.homedir | replace: "/", "" }}" directory is the one where
we generally want to keep all of our files. Other folders on a UNIX OS contain
system files and change as you install new software or upgrade your OS.

> ## Using HPC filesystems
>
> On HPC systems, you have a number of places where you can store your files.
> These differ in both the amount of space allocated and whether or not they
> are backed up.
>
> * __Home__ -- a _network filesystem_, data stored here is available
>   throughout the HPC system, and is backed up periodically; however, users
>   are limited on how much they can store.
> * __Scratch__ -- also a _network filesystem_, which has more space available
>   than the Home directory, but it is not backed up, and should not be used
>   for long term storage.
{: .callout}

You can also explore the available filesystems using `df` to show **d**isk
**f**ree space. The `-h` flag renders the sizes in a human-friendly format,
i.e., GB instead of B. The **t**ype flag `-T` shows what kind of filesystem
each resource is.

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} df -Th
```
{: .language-bash}

> ## Different results from `df`
>
> * The local filesystems (ext, tmp, xfs, zfs) will depend on whether
>   you're on the same login node (or compute node, later on).
> * Networked filesystems (beegfs, cifs, gpfs, nfs, pvfs) will be similar
>   -- but may include {{ site.remote.user }}, depending on how it
>   is [mounted][mount].

## Nodes

Recall that the individual computers that compose a cluster are called _nodes_.
On a cluster, there are different types of nodes for different types of tasks.
The node where you are right now is called the _login node_. A login node
serves as the access point to the cluster _for all users_.

As a gateway, the login node should not be used for time-consuming or
resource-intensive tasks as consuming the cpu or memory of the login node
would slow down the cluster for everyone! It is well suited for uploading
and downloading files, minor software setup, and submitting jobs to the
scheduler. Generally speaking, in these lessons, we will avoid running
jobs on the login node.

Who else is logged in to the login node?

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} who
```
{: .language-bash}

This may show only your user ID, but there are likely several other people
(including fellow learners) connected right now.

The real work on a cluster gets done by the _compute_ (or _worker_) _nodes_.
compute nodes come in many shapes and sizes, but generally are dedicated to long
or hard tasks that require a lot of computational resources.

All interaction with the compute nodes is handled by a specialized piece of
software called a scheduler (the scheduler used in this lesson is called
{{ site.sched.name }}). We'll learn more about how to use the
scheduler to submit jobs next, but for now, it can also tell us more
information about the compute nodes.

For example, we can view all of the compute nodes by running the command
`{{ site.sched.info }}`.

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} {{ site.sched.info }}
```
{: .language-bash}

{% include {{ site.snippets }}/cluster/queue-info.snip %}

A lot of the nodes are busy running work for other users: we are not alone
here!

There are also specialized machines used for managing disk storage, user
authentication, and other infrastructure-related tasks. Although we do not
typically logon to or interact with these machines directly, they enable a
number of key features like ensuring our user account and files are available
throughout the HPC system.

## What's in a Node?

All of the nodes in an HPC system have the same components as your own laptop
or desktop: _CPUs_ (sometimes also called _processors_ or _cores_), _memory_
(or _RAM_), and _disk_ space. CPUs are a computer's tool for actually running
programs and calculations. Information about a current task is stored in the
computer's memory. Disk refers to all storage that can be accessed like a file
system. This is generally storage that can hold data permanently, i.e. data is
still there even if the computer has been restarted. While this storage can be
local (a hard drive installed inside of it), it is more common for nodes to
connect to a shared, remote fileserver or cluster of servers.

With all of this in mind, we will now cover how to talk to the cluster's
scheduler and use it to start running our scripts and programs!
